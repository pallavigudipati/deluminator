/* Author: Pallavi Gudipati (CS11B044)
 * Package name: Simulator.
 */

-> The package simulates a system consisting of:
 	- counters
  	- entry-queue
	- exit-queue
   
   The rate at which the entry-queue is filled up can be
   given as an input.
  
   Each person entering the entry-queue waits till he/she reaches
   the head of the queue and goes to the open counter with the least
   counter-id.

   The amount of time a person spends at the counter is equal to the
   number of goods he/she requests. Requests can also be fulfilled
   partially.

   While exiting, the person has to stop at the head of the exit queue
   for an amount of time equal to the goods cariied by him/her.

   The entry-queue can be filled at the start of the simulation by
   giving the appropriate input.

   A counter is closed after it has exhausted all the goods allotted to it.

   The number of goods requested by a person is determined by calling
   the function Sampling(). This function has to be plugged in by the user,
   else a dummy function will be used.

   Different views can be used to generate outputs:
  	- 1 person
    - 2 counter
    - 3 in-queue
    - 4 out-queue	

-> Input Format:
	- number of counters
	- initial number of goods in each counter(iterate separately)
	- rate at which in-queue is filled
	- initial size of in-queue 
	- requests of the people in the in-queue before the simulation
	  starts(iterate separately)
	- view
